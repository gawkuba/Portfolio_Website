                        Hello! I'm a budding frontend developer with a passion
                        for turning lines of code into beautifully functional websites.
                        My journey into the world of web development has been an exciting one
                        , driven by a relentless desire to create and innovate. <p></p>
                        Currently, I'm pursuing my education at PJATK in Warsaw
                        , where I'm sharpening my skills and gaining the knowledge
                        I need to become a top-notch developer.
                        Every day is a new opportunity to explore,
                        learn, and grow, and I can't wait to see where this
                        exciting journey in web development takes me. <p></p>
                        When I'm not buried in code, you'll often find me engaged
                        in a thrilling game of chess, pushing my limits at the gym,
                        or immersed in the virtual realms of computer games.
                        These diverse interests fuel my creativity and keep me
                        energized for the challenges of coding. <p></p>
                        Beyond the screen, I'm on a continuous learning adventure.
                        I thrive on self-improvement, dedicating my free
                        time to mastering new technologies and staying
                        ahead of the ever-evolving web development landscape.
